# 2. Echo Statement

## Screenshot Name

## Description

This screenshot demonstrates how the `echo` statement is used to display output.

Example:

```

The practice also demonstrates that `echo` can display multiple values:

```php

# 3. Print Statement

## Screenshot Name

`printExample.png`

## Description

?>
```

Both examples display text in the browser.

# 4. Constants in PHP

## Description

This practice demonstrates creating and using a constant in PHP.

Example:

```php
<?php

define("AGE", "my Awesome");

echo "my Constant variable", AGE;

?>
```

The `define()` function is used to create the constant, and the constant is then displayed using `echo`.

# 5. Ternary Expression

## Screenshot Name

`Treninary.png`

## Description

This screenshot demonstrates the use of a ternary expression with `print`.

Example:

```php
<?php

$x = 5;
$y = 10;

$x < $y ? print "x is less than y" : print "x is greater than y";

?>
```

The condition checks whether `$x` is less than `$y` and prints the corresponding message.

# 6. If Else Statement

## Screenshot Name

`UsingIF_else.png`

## Description

This screenshot demonstrates decision making using an `if ... else` statement.

Example:

```php
<?php

$Age = 10;
$grade = 10;

if ($Age > 20 || $grade > 20) {

    echo "that person can vote";

} else {

    echo "that person cant vote";

}

?>
```

The condition is evaluated first. If the condition is true, the first message is displayed; otherwise, the `else` statement is executed.

# 7. Switch Statement

## Screenshot Name

`UsingSwithch.png`

## Description

This screenshot demonstrates decision making using a `switch` statement.

Example:

```php
<?php

$Grade = 90;

switch ($Grade) {

    case ($Grade >= 90):
        echo "Excellent";
        break;

    case ($Grade >= 80):
        echo "Very Godd";
        break;

    case ($Grade >= 50):
        echo "minimal pass";
        break;

    default:
        echo "not passed";
}

?>
```

The switch structure checks the grade conditions and displays the corresponding result.
